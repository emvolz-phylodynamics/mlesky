# mlesky : Maximum likelihood phylodynamic inference

This package performs inference of past population size dynamics from a dated phylogeny using a maximum likelihood approach. 
The main features are as follows:

* Three different phylodynamic models are implemented (skygrid, skygrowth and skysigma)
* A novel cross-validation approach is used for selecting the smoothing parameter 
* The resolution of the grid can be selected using AIC or BIC
* Covariate data can be included into the analysis to quantify association
* Multiple phylogenies can be analysed simultaneously that share the same demographic function

For a complete description of the statistical methodology underpinning this package, see our preprint:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427056v1.full

## Installation

In R, install the `devtools` package and run 
```
devtools::install_github('emvolz-phylodynamics/mleksy')
```

## Documentation

See the vignettes in the R package for examples of how to use mlesky.
