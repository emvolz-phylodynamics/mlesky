# Simulation

Let's consider that the effective population size was of size 10 except between 2000 and 2010 
when it was of size 1 (bottleneck model). Ten samples per year are taken at uniform timepoints 
between 1990 and 2020. We can simulate such a phylogeny using:

```{r}
library(ape)
library(mlesky)
set.seed(0)
alphaFun=function(x){if (x<2000 || x>2010) 10 else 1}
sampleDates=seq(1990,2020,0.1)
t=simCoal(sampleDates,alphaFun)
plotBoth(t,alphaFun)
```

# Inference

We now infer the past population size given the phylogeny.

```{r}
res=optim_res_aic(t,ncpu = 8)
fit=mlskygrid(t,res=res)
plot(fit)
```
